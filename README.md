>>>>> What is Flow Control ?
The sequence of execution of a any program called flow control.
There are three types of flow control.
	1) Sequential
	2) Selection
	3) Repetition
	
>>>>> What is Sequential Flow Control ?
A type of program flow control in which all statements executed one by one in a sequence. We can't skip one or more statement. 
For Example: 
	print("Hello")
	print("I'm")
	print("learning")
	print("python")
These all statemets execute one by one.

>>>>> What is Selection Flow Control ?
A type of flow control in which a statement or set of statement executed from number of code's blocks based on a condition. Selection also called conditional statements.
There are four type of conditional statements:
	1) if
	2) if else
	3) if elif else
	4) nested if else
	
>>>>> What is Repetition Flow Control ?
A type of program flow in which a statement or number of statements repeat one or more times with repect to a special condition.Repetition is also known as loops.
There are two types of loops in python.
	1) While loop
	2) For loop
We use while loop when we does't know the number of iterations.
We use for loop when we know the number of iterations.
